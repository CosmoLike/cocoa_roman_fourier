To run the example

 **Step :one:**: activate the cocoa Conda environment,  and the private Python environment 

      conda activate cocoa

and

      source start_cocoa.sh
 
 **Step :two:**: Select the number of OpenMP cores (below, we set it to 8).

  - Linux
    
        export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8; export OMP_PROC_BIND=close; \
        export OMP_PLACES=cores; export OMP_DYNAMIC=FALSE; \
        export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1; export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1

  - macOS (arm)
    
        export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8; export OMP_PROC_BIND=disabled; \
        export OMP_PLACES=cores; export OMP_DYNAMIC=FALSE; \
        export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1; export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1

 **Step :three:**: The folder `projects/roman_fourier` contains examples. So, run the `cobaya-run` on the first example following the commands below.

> [!Warning] 
> (Linux only) In some HPC nodes, `numa` can cause you problems. If that is the case,
> replace `numa` with `slot`

- **One model evaluation**:

  - Linux

          --mca pml ob1 --mca btl vader,tcp,self \
          --bind-to core:overload-allowed --report-bindings \
          --rank-by slot --map-by numa:pe=${OMP_NUM_THREADS} \
          cobaya-run ./projects/roman_fourier/EXAMPLE_EVALUATE1.yaml -f

        "${CONDA_PREFIX}"/bin/mpirun -n 4 --oversubscribe \
          --mca pml ob1 --mca btl vader,tcp,self \
          --bind-to core:overload-allowed --report-bindings \
          --rank-by slot --map-by numa:pe=${OMP_NUM_THREADS} \

# Baryonic feedback on EXAMPLE_EVALUATE1 <a name="roman_fourier_baryonic_feedback"></a>

`EXAMPLE_EVALUATE1.yaml` can apply an external baryonic feedback suppression to the
matter power spectrum via the `bfmt` theory block (SP(k), BCEmu, Flamingo, BACCOemu,
or BCemu2025). By default, the example runs without feedback.

**Step :one:**: ensure the lines below are commented out in `set_installation_options.sh`
before running `setup_cocoa.sh` and `compile_cocoa.sh`. *By default, these lines should
be commented out, but it is worth checking*.

      [Adapted from Cocoa/set_installation_options.sh shell script]
      #export IGNORE_PYSPK_CODE=1     # SP(k)
      #export IGNORE_BCEMU_CODE=1     # BCEmu
      #export IGNORE_FBRE_CODE=1      # FlamingoBaryonResponseEmulator
      #export IGNORE_BACCOEMU_CODE=1  # BACCOemu
      #export IGNORE_BFMT_CODE=1      # Baryon Feedback Theory Block

**Step :two:**: in `EXAMPLE_EVALUATE1.yaml`, uncomment the `bfmt` theory block and select
the model:

      theory:
        bfmt:
          baryon_model: 2 # 1 = SP(k), 2 = BCEmu, 3 = FlamingoEmulator, 4 = BACCOemu, 5 = BCemu2025

**Step :three:**: set `external_baryon_suppression: True` on the `roman_fourier.cosmic_shear`
likelihood block.

**Step :four:**: uncomment the selected model's parameters in the `params` block and in
the `sampler: evaluate: override` block (the example carries a commented block for each
model).

> [!TIP]
> For the sampled parameters of each model, their validity ranges, and the `bfmt`
> options, see `Cocoa/external_modules/code/baryon_suppression/README.md`.

# Running Hybrid Cosmolike-ML emulators <a name="roman_fourier_examples_emul2"></a>

> [!Warning]
> The code and examples associated with this section are still in alpha stage

While our data vector emulators are incredibly fast, there is an intermediate 
approach that emulates only the Boltzmann outputs (comoving distance, linear and 
nonlinear matter power spectrum). This hybrid-ML case can offer greater flexibility, 
especially in the initial phases of a research project, as changes to the modeling 
of nuisance parameters or to the assumed galaxy distributions do not require 
retraining of the network. 

Examples in the hybrid case all have the prefix **EXAMPLE_EMUL2** (note the `2`). The required flags on `set_installation_options.sh` are similar to what we showed in the previous emulator section.

Now, users must follow all the steps below.

 **Step :one:**: Activate the private Python environment by sourcing the script `start_cocoa.sh`

    source start_cocoa.sh

 **Step :two:**: Select the number of OpenMP cores. Below, we set it to 4, the ideal setting for hybrid examples.

  - Linux

        export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4; export OMP_PROC_BIND=close; \
        export OMP_PLACES=cores; export OMP_DYNAMIC=FALSE; \
        export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1; export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1

  - macOS (arm)
    
        export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4; export OMP_PROC_BIND=disabled; \
        export OMP_PLACES=cores; export OMP_DYNAMIC=FALSE; \
        export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1; export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1

 **Step :three:** Run `cobaya-run` on the first emulator example, following the commands below.

- **One model evaluation**:

  - Linux

        "${CONDA_PREFIX}"/bin/mpirun -n 1 --oversubscribe \
          --mca pml ob1 --mca btl vader,tcp,self \
          --bind-to core:overload-allowed --report-bindings \
          --rank-by slot --map-by numa:pe=${OMP_NUM_THREADS} \
          cobaya-run ./projects/roman_fourier/EXAMPLE_EMUL2_EVALUATE1.yaml -f

  - macOS (arm)
    
        mpirun -n 1 --oversubscribe \
          cobaya-run ./projects/roman_fourier/EXAMPLE_EMUL2_EVALUATE1.yaml -f

> [!NOTE]
> **Running on more than one node.** The flag `--mca btl vader,tcp,self` works unchanged across
> nodes: Open MPI picks the transport per pair of ranks, using shared memory (`vader`) within a
> node and TCP between nodes. Three things deserve attention on multi-node runs:
>
> 1. **Network interface.** The TCP layer must not select an interface that is not routable
>    between compute nodes. The flag `--mca btl_tcp_if_exclude lo,docker0,virbr0,ib0` excludes
>    the common offenders. TCP bandwidth is not a limitation for our workloads, which exchange
>    small, infrequent MPI messages.
>
> 2. **Environment.** Ranks on remote nodes must see Cocoa's environment (`ROOTDIR`, `PATH`,
>    `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, `CONDA_PREFIX`, the OpenMP/BLAS thread settings, and
>    `CLIK_PATH`/`CLIK_DATA`/`CLIK_PLUGIN`). Slurm forwards the submitting environment
>    automatically; the explicit `-x` flags in our sbatch templates repeat this so the
>    scripts also work under ssh-based launchers. No other Cocoa installation flags are read at runtime.
>
> 3. **Slurm geometry.** Keep `ntasks-per-node` × `cpus-per-task` no larger than the cores per
>    node, and use `--map-by numa:pe=${OMP_NUM_THREADS}` so each rank reserves the cores its
>    OpenMP threads will use.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note on core oversubscription**: an MPI process that is waiting still burns 100% of its
> core, checking for messages in a loop. With more processes than cores, this stalls the
> processes doing real work. Open MPI usually detects this and makes waiting processes give
> up the CPU, but its detection can be fooled. Adding `--mca mpi_yield_when_idle 1` forces
> that behavior; it is harmless otherwise.

# Unit tests <a name="roman_fourier_unit_tests"></a>

The `tests/` folder holds unit tests for the likelihoods of this
project: they compare each likelihood against stored reference
values, check for race conditions from OpenMP threading, and measure
the numerical error of the default accuracy settings. The
tests read nothing from the live project;
[tests/README.md](tests/README.md) describes every test, the tests'
own data snapshot, and how to refresh it.

We assume users are in the Conda cocoa environment from a previous
`conda activate cocoa` command, that the shell is bash, and that the
current folder is the cocoa main folder `cocoa/Cocoa`.

**Step :one:**: activate the private Python environment by sourcing
the script `start_cocoa.sh`

    source start_cocoa.sh

**Step :two:**: run the tests of this project

    python -m pytest ./projects/roman_fourier/tests/data_vector

## Minimum accuracy parameters <a name="roman_fourier_accuracy"></a>

The advisory checks in `tests/data_vector/test_accuracy.py` measure the
numerical error of the default accuracy settings: each setting is
raised one at a time on the 3x2pt configuration, so a large
$\Delta\chi^2$ can be attributed to the setting causing it, and
then every setting at once.

Each check prints the $\Delta\chi^2$ between the high-accuracy and
the default evaluations, to compare against the 0.2 band the
reference tests allow. No measured values are quoted here: rerun
the checks to measure them on the current code, and see
[tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for each check, the settings
raised, and what each setting controls.

The default is `accuracyboost: 2.0` with `pk_z_refinement: 2`, and the
reason must not be lost. Two grids of this project need more than
`accuracyboost: 1` (measured 2026-10-01):

- The z nodes of the power-spectrum tables. cosmolike interpolates the
  tables linearly in z between their nodes, and at the band centers of
  this Fourier-space data vector that residual does not average out:
  the 3x2pt $\chi^2$ at the synthetic test point moves by 0.25, 0.030
  and 0.002 from 1 to 2, 4 and 8 times the nodes of `accuracyboost: 1`.
  The default has 4 times the nodes: `accuracyboost: 2` doubles them
  and `pk_z_refinement: 2` doubles them again.
- The C-FAST-PT tables of the TATT and one-loop galaxy-bias terms. At
  `accuracyboost: 1` the cfastpt vs FAST-PT comparison of the tests
  (tests 15 and 16) reaches $\Delta\chi^2$ = 0.25 (cosmic shear) and
  0.31 (3x2pt), above the 0.2 band; at `accuracyboost: 2` it is 0.11
  and 0.14.

`accuracyboost` stays global: it multiplies every grid, these included,
and `pk_z_refinement` refines the z nodes alone. Under NLA alone,
`accuracyboost: 1` with `pk_z_refinement: 4` has the same z nodes and
gives a data vector within $\delta^T C^{-1} \delta = 0.005$ of the
default at a lower cost; the TATT tables are what need the boost. The
CAMB request grid stays at 140 redshifts (under CAMB's 256-node cap), so
only the cosmolike tables pay.

The project tag v5.01 shipped `accuracyboost: 1` with
`pk_z_refinement: 4`, which fails the TATT checks above; the default
returned to `accuracyboost: 2` on 2026-10-01.

> [!Warning]
> Do not lower these settings to save computing time: with fewer than 4
> times the z nodes of `accuracyboost: 1`, or with `accuracyboost` below
> 2 under TATT, the error exceeds the 0.2 accuracy budget of the
> reference tests. The likelihood yaml files repeat this next to the
> knobs.

# Computing covariances <a name="computing_covariances"></a>

[EXAMPLE_EVALUATE_COVARIANCE.ipynb](EXAMPLE_EVALUATE_COVARIANCE.ipynb)
computes a covariance with this project's 3×2pt measurement layout.
It keeps G, SSC and cNG separately, applies the supplied likelihood mask,
and plots the computed and supplied totals together.

| Measurement choice | Notebook example |
| --- | --- |
| Dataset | [data/roman_example.dataset](data/roman_example.dataset) |
| Primary space | Fourier-space 3×2pt |
| Lens bins | 8 |
| Source bins | 8 |
| Bins per two-point observable | 15, multipoles 30–4000 |
| Generated entries before cuts | 1,485 |
| Entries after the dataset mask | 1,359 |

The primary example is the 15-band Fourier 3×2pt matrix. Its nine galaxy–shear
exclusions match the project adapter and likelihood. The optional real-space
calculation describes a different measurement.

We assume Cocoa and this project are installed, users have run
`conda activate cocoa`, the shell is Bash, and the current folder is
`cocoa/Cocoa`.

**Step :one:**: activate Cocoa's private Python environment.

    source start_cocoa.sh

**Step :two:**: compile the project interface.

    unset IGNORE_COSMOLIKE_ROMAN_FOURIER_CODE
    source ./projects/roman_fourier/scripts/compile_roman_fourier.sh

**Step :three:**: start Jupyter.

    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8888

**Step :four:**: open the printed URL and select
`projects/roman_fourier/EXAMPLE_EVALUATE_COVARIANCE.ipynb`.

**Step :five:**: inspect the survey inputs and keep `boosts = [1]` for the
first calculation, then select **Kernel → Restart Kernel and Run All Cells**.
Set `boosts = [1, 2]` to add the accuracy comparison.

The notebook writes `covariance/forecast_fourier.npz`,
`covariance/forecast_camb.npz` and
`covariance/forecast_likelihood_selection.npz`. The last archive retains
both cut totals and the original data-vector indices.
Set `spaces = ["real", "fourier"]` to compute both transformations; only the native space is compared with the supplied likelihood.
The [covariance guide](covariance/README.md) describes the physical inputs,
component plots, accuracy controls and covariance-only tests.

> [!NOTE]
> The generated matrix is an analogous forecast, not a reproduction of the
> supplied likelihood covariance. It uses massless neutrinos, Limber,
> linear bias, zero IA/magnification/RSD and a spherical-cap footprint.
> Numerical defaults still need convergence validation. The notebook uses
> eight OpenMP threads and one BLAS thread. `accuracy_boost` refines
> tables and cutoffs; `integration_accuracy` separately selects precomputed
> GSL rules from [covariance/default.yaml](covariance/default.yaml).
