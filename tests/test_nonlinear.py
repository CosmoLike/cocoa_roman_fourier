"""Advisory checks NL1-NL2: Halofit vs EuclidEmulator2.

The likelihoods can source the nonlinear matter power from CAMB's
Takahashi halofit (non_linear_emul: 2, the frozen contract's
setting) or from EuclidEmulator2 (non_linear_emul: 1). NL1
evaluates the cosmic-shear data vector and NL2 the 3x2pt data
vector with both sources at ten fixed cosmologies across the
omegam/ns/As space (NONLINEAR_COMPARISON_POINTS; every other
parameter stays at the frozen fiducial) and reports, at each
cosmology, the chi2 of the Halofit vector against the EE2 vector
(delta^T C^-1 delta; the EE2 vector is that cosmology's fiducial,
so the baseline is zero by construction).

There is no pass/fail: the numbers say how much of the statistical
error budget the Halofit-vs-emulator difference consumes under the
chosen scale cuts - the question "can Halofit be used on real data
analysis at this mask". The checks read the --mask option of the
comparison sweeps (conftest.py): --mask=frozen (the contract mask,
the default) or --mask=ones (every data point kept).

To run (from the Cocoa/ folder, cocoa environment active,
start_cocoa.sh sourced):

    python -m pytest ./projects/roman_fourier/tests/test_nonlinear.py

    python -m pytest ./projects/roman_fourier/tests/test_nonlinear.py --mask=ones
