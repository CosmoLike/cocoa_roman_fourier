"""Accuracy advisory checks A1-A6: default vs high-accuracy settings.

Every reference in this suite is computed with the examples' default
numerical settings. These checks answer: how much numerical error do
those defaults carry? Each one re-evaluates a frozen configuration at
its frozen point with the numerical knobs pushed beyond the defaults
(cosmolike: accuracyboost 3 instead of 2, internal_accuracyboost 2,
integration_accuracy 10, kmax_boltzmann 40; CAMB: AccuracyBoost 2.0,
k_per_logint 50, kmax 50; the exact values live in
cocoa_test_utils.HIGH_ACCURACY_LIKELIHOOD and
HIGH_ACCURACY_CAMB_EXTRA_ARGS) and reports

    delta chi2 = chi2(high accuracy) - chi2(default, frozen)

The checks are advisory: they print the number and assert nothing,
because how much numerical error an analysis tolerates is a judgment
call. The six checks cover the three probes with both intrinsic-alignment
(IA) models, NLA (nonlinear alignment) and TATT (tidal alignment and
tidal torquing):

  A1. cosmic shear (example1), NLA      A2. cosmic shear, TATT
  A3. 2x2pt (example2_2x2pt), NLA       A4. 2x2pt, TATT
  A5. 3x2pt (example2), NLA             A6. 3x2pt, TATT

The TATT checks evaluate against their configuration's TATT-generated
data vector (written at freeze time), so the chi2 sits at a minimum and
the delta is a stable, quadratic response instead of a linear one. Before
A1-A6, test_a0 raises one knob at a time (the KNOB lines of the output).

A high-accuracy evaluation takes minutes, not seconds: the whole file
is far slower than the rest of the suite. To run only this file (from
the Cocoa/ folder, cocoa environment active, start_cocoa.sh sourced):

    python -m pytest ./projects/roman_fourier/tests/data_vector/test_accuracy.py

and to run the rest of the suite without it:

    python -m pytest ./projects/roman_fourier/tests --ignore \\
        ./projects/roman_fourier/tests/data_vector/test_accuracy.py
